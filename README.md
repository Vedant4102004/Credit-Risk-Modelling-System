# Credit-Risk-Modelling-System
This project aims to predict credit risk using machine learning, helping financial institutions assess borrower reliability and make informed lending decisions. By analyzing financial history, loan records, and behavioral patterns, the system generates a risk score, reducing defaults and optimizing loan approvals. 

# Credit Risk Modelling System  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Credit Risk Modelling System** is designed to assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. Using **machine learning techniques**, the system evaluates historical financial data, behavioral patterns, and key risk factors to generate a predictive **credit risk score**.  

This project is useful for **financial institutions, banks, and fintech companies** to make data-driven lending decisions and minimize risk exposure.  

## 🛠 Features  
- **Risk Assessment Model** – Predicts the probability of loan defaults using machine learning.  
- **Data Preprocessing Pipeline** – Cleans and transforms raw financial data for analysis.  
- **Explainability & Interpretability** – Implements SHAP values for model insights.  
- **Automated Report Generation** – Creates reports highlighting risk factors and score interpretations.  
- **Web-Based Dashboard** – Interactive UI for visualizing loan applicant risk scores.  

## 🔍 Working Mechanism  
The system follows a **structured pipeline** for evaluating risk:  

1️⃣ **Data Collection** – Historical loan records, transaction history, credit scores, and borrower demographics.  
2️⃣ **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering** – Handling missing values, normalizing data, and creating predictive features.  
3️⃣ **Model Training** – Using algorithms like **Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression** for risk prediction.  
4️⃣ **Evaluation & Optimization** – Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation for accuracy improvement.  
5️⃣ **Risk Score Generation** – Assigning risk levels such as **Low, Medium, High** based on predictive outputs.  
6️⃣ **Visualization & Decision Support** – Providing lenders with clear insights into applicant risk.  

## 📊 Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language** – Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks** – Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Flask  
- **Database** – PostgreSQL / MySQL (for borrower data storage)  
- **Frontend** – Streamlit or Flask (for user-friendly interface)  
- **Deployment** – Docker + Cloud hosting (AWS / Heroku)  

## 📥 Installation  
Follow these steps to set up the system locally:  

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-risk-modelling.git

```

## 🗂 Dataset  
The model is trained on diverse datasets, including:  
- **Bank Loan Records** – Data on past loans and repayment behavior.  
- **Customer Financial History** – Credit scores, income, and spending habits.  
- **Demographic Data** – Age, employment status, location impact on credit risk.  

🔹 You can use **open-source financial datasets** from sources like Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  

## 🎯 Applications  
- **Loan Approval Systems** – Helps banks make better lending decisions.  
- **Fraud Detection** – Identifies unusual financial patterns.  
- **Personalized Loan Offers** – Adjusts interest rates based on predicted risk levels.  

## 🌱 Future Enhancements  
🔄 **Deep Learning Models** – Integration of **Neural Networks** for improved accuracy.  
💡 **Alternative Data Sources** – Incorporating **social media activity, spending patterns, and real-time market fluctuations**.  
📡 **API Integration** – Allowing banks to connect directly to the system for real-time risk evaluation.
