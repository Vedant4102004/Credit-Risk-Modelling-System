# Credit-Risk-Modelling-System
This project aims to predict credit risk using machine learning, helping financial institutions assess borrower reliability and make informed lending decisions. By analyzing financial history, loan records, and behavioral patterns, the system generates a risk score, reducing defaults and optimizing loan approvals.
